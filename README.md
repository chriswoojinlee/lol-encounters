# lol-encounters

A Java web application for LoL that scans a ranked solo/duo queue lobby and checks whether you have played with or 
against any players in that lobby in the past, and if so, displays any applicable match history

- Enter a username to see a detailed overview of your account's ranked solo/duo queue stats
- Then, copy and paste in a ranked solo/duo queue lobby to the app to receive a brief overview of all other players in 
that lobby and see which players you have previously played with
