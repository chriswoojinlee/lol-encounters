# lol-encounters

A Java web application for LoL that scans a ranked solo/duo queue lobby and checks how many matches you have played with 
or against any players in that lobby in the past

- Enter a username to see an overview of your account's ranked solo/duo queue stats
- Then, copy and paste in a ranked solo/duo queue lobby to the app to receive a brief statistical overview of all other players in that lobby and see which players you have previously played with
