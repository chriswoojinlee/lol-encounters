# lol-blacklist
Encountered a griefer, win-trader, or just really bad player on your team in League of Legends? This blacklist app, intended for high-elo players (chances are, you'll never encounter the same players again in low-elo), keeps track of a blacklist of players to avoid in your ranked solo/duo queue games, based on your match history. Now when that one player you probably can't ever win with is on your team, you'll be notified that the player is on your blacklist and you'll know to just save your LP by dodging. Live to fight another day!

- Add and remove players from a blacklist-style dodge list to remember to which players to dodge on sight, and disassociate bad players that redeemed themselves from the dodge list
- Add, edit, and delete notes corresponding to each player on your blacklist to remember in the future why you should dodge that player on sight
- Copy and paste in a ranked solo/duo queue lobby to the app, and it will search for any past games with other players in that lobby
- Games previously played with players in a lobby on your team are displayed, along with any blacklisted players and their corresponding stats and notes, notifying you to consider dodging
